	    Dr. Makoto Nagao is a pioneer in machine translation,
	    natural language processing and image processing. He had
	    conducted many large projects and led them to success. In
	    addition to his distinguished achievements in those
	    research areas, he is the most prominent leader of digital
	    libraries research in Japan. Dr. Nagao developed a
	    prototype digital library system, "Ariadne", based on his
	    rich experiences in natural language processing and
	    artificial intelligence. He conducted digital library
	    development at Kyoto University Library which was one of
	    the first large digital library services in Japanese
	    university libraries.

	    directions and challenges for Google Book Search'', Daniel
	    Clancy (Google, USA)</p>
	  <p><i>abstract: </i>Google Book Search is an ambitious project
	started by Google to realize a dream that the founders of
	Google have had since they were students at Stanford.  This
	dream is to make all the worlds information fully searchable
	to create a universal digital library.  There are of course
	numerous technical challenges that must be addressed to
	accomplish this goal.  The first one is the ability to scan
	the books in a scalable manner.  Once the books have become
	available, however, there is a rich set of research challenges
	that must be addressed to organize this information. In this
	talk, I will talk about some of the challenges already
	addressed and will discuss future directions for Google Book
	search and the research challenges that exist for the field of
	Digital Libraries.</p>

	<td><p>Dr. Daniel J. Clancy, PhD, is the Engineering Director
	  for Google Book Search.  The goal of the Google Book Search
	  project is to digitize the world's books and make them
	  searchable online.  Google is working with both publishers
	  and libraries as part of this project. Prior to coming to
	  Google in January 2005, Dr. Clancy was the Director of the
	  Exploration Technologies Directorate at NASA Ames Research
	  Center. The Directorate supports over 700 people performing
	  both basic and applied research in a diverse range of
	  technology areas intended to enable both robotic and human
	  exploration missions.  Technology areas include Intelligent
	  Systems, High-end Computing, Human-Centered Systems,
	  Bio/Nanotechnology, Entry Systems and others.  In this role,
	  Dr. Clancy played numerous roles at the agency level
	  including participating in the team that developed the
	  agency's plan to return men to the Moon and eventually
	  Mars. Dr. Clancy received his PhD from the University of
	  Texas at Austin in artificial intelligence. While in school,
	  Dr. Clancy also worked at Trilogy Corporation, the NASA Jet
	  Propulsion Laboratory and Xerox Webster Research
	  center. Dr. Clancy received a Bachelor of Arts from Duke
	  University in 1985 in computer science and theatre.</p>
