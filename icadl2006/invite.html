	  <p><i>abstract: </i>
	    Cyberinfrastructure is now considered crucial in many
	    countries, not only for advancing scientific researches
	    but also for promoting educational activities based on
	    digital contents such as scholarly databases, e-journals
	    and coursewares in higher education.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The Cyber Science Infrastructure (CSI) is a new initiative
	    aiming at a comprehensive framework in which Japanese
	    universities and research institutions are collaboratively
	    constructing an IT-based environment for boosting
	    scientific research and educational activities.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In CSI, sharing of electronic resources is promoted, and
	    the dissemination of scholarly information originating
	    from universities are strongly encouraged.  CSI could be
	    regarded as a new model of distributed and virtual digital
	    library in the future academic environment.

	  <p><i>abstract: </i>
	    Library and information schools in Asia Pacific, like
	    their counterparts around the world, have put in earnest
	    efforts to meet the challenges of educating future
	    information professionals in this dynamic and fast
	    changing networked information society.  Upcoming and
	    ongoing initiatives that offer potential collaboration and
	    co-operation among various stakeholders in Asia Pacific
	    are identified and discussed in this presentation. The aim
	    is to foster and promote further dialogue among LIS
	    educators, researchers and practitioners, and to engender
	    participation in these activities.  By no means
	    exhaustive, areas covered include (1) hosting and
	    participating in workshops, symposiums and conferences;
	    (2) implementing a portal for education; (3) developing a
	    repository of learning objects and resources; (4) assuring
	    quality through accreditation; and (5) promoting and
	    sustaining research and scholarship.  Collectively, these
	    areas lay a foundation to create an informal network to
	    improve information exchange and dissemination, knowledge
	    sharing and creation, and research collaboration, thereby
	    helping to further improve and ensure high standards of
	    LIS education, practice and research in the region.

	  Libraries: With your help, what the $100 laptop and its
	  sunlight readable display might enable'', Mary Lou Jepson
	  (One Laptop per Child, USA)</p>

	  <p><i>abstract: </i>
	    At the end of the day, children are the world's most
	    valuable resource.  In much of the developing world, such
	    children are lucky to have a teacher with a 6th grade
	    education.  To improve the situation, we are trying to
	    leverage the kids themselves through peer to peer learning
	    enabled by our laptops and the mesh network they create.
	    Study after study show that kids take to computers quickly
	    and easily, not just in the in rich countries like Japan,
	    but in the slums of the developing world.  An average
	    5-year-old child in any country is a curious, engaging and
	    energetic sponge for information and knowledge.  </p>

	  <p>
	    I will discuss the laptop architecture, the display, and
	    what it could enable for digital libraries and the
	    children of the world in my presentation - who read the
	    textbooks through the laptop by looking at the display.
	    These laptops are cheaper than textbooks for children
	    (over 5 years of usage) and will be owned by the children
	    themselves.
