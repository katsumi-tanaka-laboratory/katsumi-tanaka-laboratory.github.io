<h3 align="center">Believable Conversational Virtual Humans<br>
  HyungSeok Kim<br>
  University of Geneva, Switzerland </h3>
<h4 align="center">Abstract</h4>
<div class="desc">Believability is a term to measure a level of realism in the
  interactive virtual environment. In this paper, the believability is described
  in two layered manner. The elementary layer consists of fundamental aspect
  of the system including immersion, presentation and interaction. These aspects
  are discussed in uni- and multi-sensory channel including visual, auditory
  and haptic. In a higher layer, emotion and personality is one of the main issues
  to provoke believability. The effects of elements are described in perception
  and generation of facial expressions and motions for conversational virtual
  humans.</div>
<h4 align="center">Biography</h4>
<div class="desc">Dr. HyungSeok Kim is a senior research assistant at Miralab,
  University of Geneva. He received his PhD in Computer Science in February 2003
  at VRLab, KAIST : "Multiresolution model generation of texture-geometry for
  the real-time rendering". His main research field is Real-time Rendering for
  Virtual Environments, more specifically Multiresolution Modeling and Texture
  Map Generation. He is also interested in 3D Interaction techniques and Virtual
  Reality Systems. </div>

<h3 align="center">Ubiquitous Knowledge Access<br>
  Rainer Malaka<br>
  European Media Laboratory, Germany </h3>
<h4 align="center">Abstract</h4>
<div class="desc">The challenge of ubiquitous computing is not just access to
  data on all possible locations. It rather aims at providing intelligent services
  in all situations. Thus, intelligent systems should know about a user's location,
  the situation and services in order to provide most useful information in a
  given context. This perspective goes well beyond networking questions because
  systems must have and use knowledge about context and data. The Semantic Web
  is one attempt to enrich IT systems with semantics and to allow for more intelligent
  services. This can be combined with Ubiquitous Computing for building smart
  assistants that know about the user's context and can, for instance, answer
  to questions like "How big is mount Fuji" with an altitude (3776 meters) rather
  than with a selection of links to Web sites. The talk will present some present
  research work of EML on rich semantic services for mobile users. In these projects
  various techniques ranging from resource-adaptive middleware to semantic analysis
  of texts are combined in order to allow for ubiquitous knowledge access.</div>
<h4 align="center">Biography</h4>
<div class="desc">Rainer Malaka is group leader at the European Media Laboratory
  (EML) and directs a research group with the focus on intelligent mobile assistance
  systems. He joined EML in October 1997 where he initiated and leads the "Personal
  Memory" research group. The research in his group is inter- and multi-disciplinary
  with aspects ranging from language understanding, geographical information
  systems, computer vision to mobile computing and middleware. Before joining
  EML, Dr. Malaka worked at the University of Karlsruhe as a research scientist
  on neural networks and learning algorithms. In his PhD work he worked on models
  learning in biological brains.</div>

<h3 align="center">Directing the Users' Attention in the Search of Large Video
  Collections<br>
  Andreas Girgensohn<br>
  FX Palo Alto Laboratory, USA </h3>
<h4 align="center">Abstract</h4>
<div class="desc">Users such as intelligence analysts frequently have the need
  to quickly find video clips relevant to a topic expressed in text and images.
  Video searches does not produce very accurate results and there are many potential
  matches in large video collections. This makes it is important to direct the
  users attention to the most promising material and to indicate to them what
  material they already investigated. Based on this premise, we created a search
  interface for large video collections with time-aligned text transcripts. A
  key component of the system is a powerful and flexible user interface that
  incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects. The
  interface displays search results in ranked sets of story keyframe collages,
  and lets users explore the shots in a story. By adapting the keyframe collages
  based on query relevance and indicating which portions of the video have already
  been explored, we enable users to quickly find relevant sections. We tested
  our system as part of the NIST TRECVID interactive search evaluation, and found
  that our user interface enabled users to find more relevant results within
  the allotted time than those of many systems employing more sophisticated analysis
  techniques.</div>

<div class="desc">Andreas Girgensohn is a senior research scientist in the Interactive
  Media group at FX Palo Alto Laboratory. He is involved in several projects
  concerned with the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of applications
  for video editing and indexing and for organizing digital photos. Andreas'
  research combines his interests in creating tools to support developers and
  end users, designing user interfaces, and improving communication and collaboration
  among people using multiple media and the Web. Prior to that, he worked at
  NYNEX Science & Technology on task-oriented user interface design and development,
  on support for software developers, and on tools for improving communication
  and collaboration. He received a PhD in computer science from the University
