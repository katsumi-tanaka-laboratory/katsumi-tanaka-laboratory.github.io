    <td colspan="2">The development of Web-based technologies has prompted the
      re-emergence of semantics-related issues as the kernel to support meaningful
      information exchange processes. In this context, ontologies have gained
      worldwide attention as most suitable means to model information semantics.
      A large body of research has already investigated ontology representation
      and reasoning, mainly in the realm of logic-based approaches. Unfortunately,
      these approaches are known not to scale up to the size needed by Web-based
      interactions. Scalability, instead, is not a problem for database technology.
      Hence, some authors have suggested a database-oriented approach to ontologies.
      This talk overviews the characteristic features of ontologies to show what
      makes then inherently different from a database, despite some strong similarity.
      As a consequence, a hybrid approach, joining ontological services with
      database services, is advocated as the most promising direction for full
      and scalable development of ontologies</td>

    <td colspan="2">Cost is the number-one healthcare issue in developed countries
      and a significant and growing fraction of the gross national product is
      spent on healthcare. At the same time, rapid progress in information and
      networking technologies promises at least partial solutions to the problem
      of containing costs of healthcare, while improving its quality. In my talk,
      I will review the confluence of multiple technologies, such as electronic
      medical patient records, ubiquitous information access, medical sensors,
      and advanced data mining and analysis, providing a foundation for the healthcare
      for the 21 century. I will illustrate these trends with examples of real-time
      management of clinical and administrative data and wellness monitoring
      using wireless sensor networks. </td>

    <td colspan="2">The Semantic Web and the Web service paradigm are currently
      the most important trends on the way to the next generation of the Web.
      They promise new opportunities for content and service provision based
      on federative architectures, enabling manifold and flexible new applications
      and improved support for individual and cooperative tasks. The use of the
      Web service paradigm in the development of Web applications, that typically
      couple application databases with user dialogs, is quite obvious. The development
      of Web applications that can be operated effectively in the Semantic Web
      context (Semantic Web Applications), however, imposes some challenges.
      Two main challenges towards extended (conceptual) modeling support are
      addressed in this talk:<br>
      1) In the Semantic Web, Web applications move from a purely human user
      community towards a mixed user community consisting of humans as well as
      of software agents; This results into new requirements towards models for
      Web applications’ user interfaces;<br>
      2) Automatic interpretation of content, one of the main building blocks
      of the Semantic Web, is based on interlinking local models with globally
      defined interpretation schemes like vocabularies and ontologies; This has
      to be reflected by the conceptual application domain models of Semantic
      Web Applications </td>

      A lot of researches on web analysis against snapshot of web space have
      been done so far, such as web information extraction and integration. We
      are interested in the evolutionary change of the cyber world. Database
